**What type of documentation issue is this?**

- [ ] Missing documentation (topic not covered at all)
- [ ] Incorrect or outdated content (wrong info, deprecated API, old screenshots)
- [ ] Unclear or confusing explanation
- [ ] Broken link or missing reference
- [ ] Code example doesn't work or is wrong
- [ ] Typo / grammar / formatting
- [ ] Other

**Where is the issue?**
Provide the exact URL, file path, or section name.
Ex. `https://yourproject.dev/docs/auth` → "Token Refresh" section
Ex. `docs/api/hooks.md` → `useModal()` — missing entirely

**What does it currently say?**
Paste or quote the problematic content.
If documentation is missing entirely, describe what topic is absent.

**What should it say or cover?**
Provide a suggested correction, rewrite, or outline.
The more specific you are here, the faster this gets resolved.

**Impact**

- [ ] Critical — blocks users from completing a core task
- [ ] High — causes significant confusion or sends users in the wrong direction
- [ ] Medium — confusing but users can work around it
- [ ] Low — minor typo or polish

**Who is most affected?**

- [ ] New contributors / first-time setup
- [ ] End users
- [ ] Developers integrating the project
- [ ] Maintainers / advanced contributors
- [ ] All audiences

**Are you willing to contribute a fix?**

- [ ] Yes — I'll open a PR with the correction
- [ ] Partially — I can draft the content but need review
- [ ] No — submitting for the team to fix

**Additional context**
Related PRs, issues, or source code that should be referenced.
Ex. The `useModal()` hook was added in PR #198 but was never documented.
